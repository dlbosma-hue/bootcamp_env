    "### Lab 2.03 - Multi-Provider News Summarizer\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python application that fetches news articles via NewsAPI and processes them through multiple LLM providers (OpenAI and Anthropic) to generate summaries and sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What It Does\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fetches news** from NewsAPI by category (technology, business, health, general)\n",
    "2. **Summarizes** each article in 2-3 sentences using OpenAI (`gpt-4o-mini`)\n",
    "3. **Analyzes sentiment** of each summary using Anthropic (`claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`)\n",
    "4. **Generates a report** with all summaries, sentiments, and a cost breakdown\n",
    "5. Supports **async processing** for concurrent article handling\n",
    "6. Includes **provider fallback** — if one LLM fails, the other takes over\n",
    "7. Tracks **token usage and costs** in real time with budget limits\n",
    "\n",

    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Install dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Create a `.env` file\n",

    "- [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/)\n",
    "- [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Verify configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "When you import any module, `config.py` automatically validates that all required keys are present.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Run: Notebook \n",
    "\n",
    "Open `main.ipynb` and run the cells. You will be prompted to choose:\n",
    "- News category\n",
    "- Number of articles (1-10)\n",
    "- Sync or async processing\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cost Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "| Model | Role | Price (per 1M tokens) | Typical usage per article |\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| gpt-4o-mini | Summarization | $0.15 input / $0.60 output | ~120 input, ~80 output tokens |\n",
    "| claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 | Sentiment analysis | $3.00 input / $15.00 output | ~110 input, ~90 output tokens |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Per article cost:** ~$0.002 (2 API calls: 1 OpenAI + 1 Anthropic)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Processing 10 articles:** ~$0.02\n",
    "\n",
    "The application includes a configurable daily budget (default $5.00) with warnings at 90% usage and a hard stop when exceeded. Using `gpt-4o-mini` for the bulk summarization work keeps costs low, while Anthropic handles the more nuanced sentiment analysis.\n"
