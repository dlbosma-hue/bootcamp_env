    "\n",
    "The following tests confirmed MCP is working correctly:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **List directory** — Claude listed the contents of `bootcamp_env` and correctly identified\n",
    "   existing folders and the `mcp_extra.ipynb` notebook file.\n",

    "   mcp_extra.ipynb   results\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "2. **Read file** — Claude read the contents of `mcp_test.txt` after it was created via Terminal.\n",
    "   File content confirmed: `Hello MCP! This is a test file.`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Write file** — Claude created `mcp_hello.txt` with the content `MCP is working!` directly\n",
    "   inside `bootcamp_env/`. The file was verified to exist after creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Query available MCP tools** — Claude confirmed it had one MCP server configured (`filesystem`)\n",
    "   by reading `~/.claude/mcp-servers.json` and listed all 8 available tools scoped to `bootcamp_env`.\n",

    "\n",
    "| Issue | Cause | Solution |\n",
    "|-------|-------|----------|\n",
    "| Config folder did not exist | Fresh Claude Code install on Mac | Created folder manually with `mkdir -p ~/.claude` |\n",
    "| Library folder not visible in Finder | macOS hides Library by default | Used Terminal or held Option key in Finder Go menu to access it |\n",
    "| Claude Code used different config path | Claude Code manages its own config separately from Claude Desktop | Accepted both config files; Claude Code uses `~/.claude/mcp-servers.json` |\n",
    "| `mcp_test.txt` not found on first attempt | File had not been created yet | Created the file via Terminal, then Claude could read it successfully |\n",

    "##### Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- MCP servers run locally using `npx`, which requires Node.js to be installed.\n",
    "- Node.js version used: `v24.13.1`\n",
    "- The filesystem server only has access to the scoped directory. This is a security feature.\n",
    "- Always restart Claude Code after editing the config file for changes to take effect.\n",
    "- Never commit API keys or tokens to Git if adding API-based MCP servers in future.\n",
    "- The `mcp_hello.txt` and `mcp_test.txt` files created during testing remain in `bootcamp_env/` as proof of successful read/write operations.\n"
