    "**Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab built a creative AI agent named Becma using LangChain's tool-calling framework. The agent handles fictional complaints about inconsistencies in the Normal Objects universe (Stranger Things inspired). The goal was to understand how freeform agents work and, just as importantly, to debug why they don't work when something goes wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final implementation required working through five distinct problems before the agent behaved correctly. Each is documented below alongside what was observed, why it happened, and what fixed it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agent Design**\n",
    "\n",
    "Becma was built with four `@tool`-decorated functions. The LLM reads each tool's docstring to decide whether to use it, so clear descriptions are essential for correct tool selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Tool | Purpose |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| `consult_demogorgon` | Monster-eye-view response (uses `random.choice`) |\n",
    "| `check_hawkins_records` | Keyword-based simulated records lookup |\n",
    "| `cast_interdimensional_spell` | Random themed solution suggestions (uses `random.sample`) |\n",
    "| `gather_party_wisdom` | Character dialogue as collective insight |\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperature was set to `0.7` for creative but not chaotic output. The compiled LangGraph agent (`create_agent`) manages the think -> tool -> think loop internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problems Encountered & How They Were Fixed**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 1 — Broken imports: `AgentExecutor` and `create_openai_tools_agent` no longer exist**\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Symptom:* `ImportError` on startup; the boilerplate from older tutorials failed immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain 1.x removed `AgentExecutor` and `create_openai_tools_agent` entirely. Several other imports also moved from `langchain` to `langchain_core`. The entire agent construction pattern changed. Instead of manually composing a prompt + agent + executor, `create_agent` returns a compiled LangGraph that handles the loop internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Fix:* Replace `create_openai_tools_agent` + `AgentExecutor` with `create_agent(llm, tools, system_prompt=...)` from `langchain.agents`. Import `tool` from `langchain_core.tools`, not `langchain.tools`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 2 — `random` not imported: tools failed silently**\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Symptom:* Tools ran without crashing visibly, but `consult_demogorgon` and `cast_interdimensional_spell` produced no output or returned errors swallowed by the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both tools use `random.choice` and `random.sample`. Without `import random` at the top of the notebook, these raised a `NameError` at runtime. Because LangGraph catches tool errors internally and continues, the failure wasn't immediately obvious; the agent just produced thin responses with no tool output.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Fix:* Add `import random` to the setup cell. Always import standard library modules explicitly. LangGraph does not surface tool `NameError`s loudly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 3 — `config` is a reserved parameter name in LangChain tools**\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Symptom:* Attempting to use a `config` parameter in a `@tool` function for callback tracking caused silent failures or unexpected behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain's `@tool` decorator intercepts any parameter named `config` and treats it as a special runtime configuration object (`RunnableConfig`). Using it as a regular user-facing argument either conflicts with the framework internals or gets silently overwritten.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Fix:* Rename any tool parameter called `config` to something else (e.g. `settings`, `options`). The reserved name `config` is off-limits for custom tool arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 4 — `ToolUsageTracker` defined after it was used: tracker always showed zeros**\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Symptom:* Tool usage counts were always 0 even after complaints ran successfully with tool calls visible in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ToolUsageTracker` class definition appeared in a later cell than the complaint-running cell. Running cells in order (or re-running only the complaint cell) meant the class was being reinstantiated fresh; every run started with an empty tracker, discarding any previously accumulated counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Fix:* Move the `ToolUsageTracker` class definition and the `tracker = ToolUsageTracker()` instantiation to a cell that runs *before* `handle_complaint` is called. Cell execution order is state. In notebooks, position matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 5 — System prompt too permissive: model skipped tools entirely**\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Symptom:* The agent returned fluent, on-theme answers but tool counts stayed at 0. The model was answering from its own knowledge without calling any tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original system prompt included language like \"you don't have to use tools if you can answer directly.\" GPT-4o-mini took that opt-out and consistently answered without tool calls. The responses looked fine on the surface but no tools were ever invoked.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Fix:* Replace the permissive phrasing with an explicit instruction: `\"You MUST use at least 2 tools to investigate every complaint before writing your response.\"` Freeform agents need clear directives; ambiguous instructions produce inconsistent behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Lesson: Where Tool Calls Actually Live in LangGraph 1.x**\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no `intermediate_steps`, no `AgentExecutor`, and no callback system needed to see what tools were called. Tool calls are recorded directly in the message list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for msg in result[\"messages\"]:\n",
    "    if hasattr(msg, \"tool_calls\") and msg.tool_calls:\n",
    "        for tc in msg.tool_calls:\n",
    "            tracker.track_usage(tc[\"name\"])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`result[\"messages\"]` is a list of `HumanMessage`, `AIMessage`, and `ToolMessage` objects. Tool calls live as `.tool_calls` on `AIMessage` objects. Inspect the message list, not a separate log.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Freeform Agent vs Structured Workflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Freeform Agent | Structured Workflow |\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "| Tool order | Decided by the model | Defined by the developer |\n",
    "| Output consistency | Variable across runs | Predictable and reproducible |\n",
    "| Best for | Creative, open-ended tasks | Business-critical processes |\n",
    "| Testability | Hard (non-deterministic) | Easy (fixed steps) |\n",
    "| Auditability | Difficult | Easy |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pitfalls Identified\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tool tracker showing 0 despite visible tool activity:** The tracker must be initialized and `track_usage()` must be called inside `handle_complaint` before any results are analyzed. If the tracker cell runs after the complaints cell without the tracker being connected to the agent's output, it stays at 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agent ignoring some tools:** The agent did not use `cast_interdimensional_spell` or `gather_party_wisdom` for every complaint. This is expected -- the agent makes its own judgment. If you need every tool to always run, you must use a structured approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-determinism:** Running the same complaint twice can produce different tool combinations, different tool argument values, and different final responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parallel tool calls are harder to track:** When the agent calls two tools simultaneously, they appear as a single step in the message history rather than two sequential steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Freeform agents are well-suited for creative or entertainment-focused applications where output variety is acceptable. For production workflows where consistency, auditability, and step-by-step control matter, LangGraph with explicit node definitions is the better fit. The most important skill is not just knowing how to build either pattern. It is knowing how to debug the gap between what the agent does and what you intended it to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use a freeform LangChain agent (like this lab) when:**\n",
    "- The task is open-ended or creative\n",
    "- The order tools are used does not matter\n",
    "- You want the model to make judgment calls about what is relevant\n",
    "- Output variety is acceptable or even desirable (creative writing, brainstorming, entertainment)\n",
    "- You want to build quickly and iterate\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use a structured workflow when:**\n",
    "- The task is business-critical (refunds, medical data, financial processing)\n",
    "- Tool order matters (step A must always happen before step B)\n",
    "- You need the same input to always produce the same process\n",
    "- The system will be audited, tested, or monitored in production\n",
    "- You need fine-grained control over error handling at each step\n",
    "\n",
    "Both approaches are valid. The decision comes down to how much control you need over the process versus how much flexibility you want to give the model."
