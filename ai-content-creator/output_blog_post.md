# The New Gym in Town Problem

Priya opens her laptop in a WeWork in Singapore. She's been here three weeks for a client project. Back in London, she has a gym membership she's still paying for—one she hasn't used since September. Two days ago, she paid £18 to drop into a Pilates class near her hotel. Tomorrow, she'll probably do it again.

This is the math that doesn't work anymore.

Annual contracts still dominate the fitness industry. Neighborhood loyalty. An assumption that your Tuesday morning spin class will be at the same studio, on the same bike, taught by the same instructor who knows you take your coffee black.

But Priya's Tuesday morning is in three different cities this quarter. Her gym in London sits empty while she pays £89 a month for the privilege of not going.

## The Infrastructure Gap

Work became location-agnostic faster than fitness did.

A decade ago, remote work meant freelancers and digital nomads—a small, self-selected group who'd figured out how to make it work. Now it's management consultants, product designers, sales directors, and compliance officers. People with corporate jobs and normal lives who just happen to be in Dubai one week and Berlin the next.

Their Slack works everywhere. Their Notion works everywhere. Their Spotify works everywhere.

Their gym membership? Locked to a three-block radius in a city they're in maybe 60% of the time.

Traditional gym models assumed stability. They were built for people who lived and worked in the same place, who could commit to showing up at 6 AM on Tuesdays and Thursdays, who'd see the same faces in the locker room for years. That model worked when work was a building you went to.

Now work is a laptop. And the gym industry is still selling you a building.

MoveAtlas runs 1,000+ studios across 15+ cities worldwide. Paying for multiple memberships, or paying drop-in rates that make you wince, or just skipping workouts entirely when you travel—none of these are actually alternatives. They're just friction pretending to be a business model.

## What Happens When the Gym Moves With You

Priya's membership works in Singapore. It worked in London before she left. It'll work in New York when she's there in March.

Same login. Same app. Same monthly price.

She books a 7 AM strength class at a studio in Tanjong Pagar the way she'd book one in Shoreditch—three taps, confirmation, done. The studio owner in Singapore doesn't know Priya flew in from London. He just knows his Thursday morning class that usually runs half-empty now has 19 people in it, and seven of them are MoveAtlas members who wouldn't have found him otherwise.

Empty class slots are wasted infrastructure. A yoga instructor teaching to four people in a room that holds twenty is a subsidy, not a business model. MoveAtlas fills those slots with people who are already in the neighborhood, already looking for a workout, already willing to pay. Studios get predictable monthly revenue from members who show up. No acquisition cost. No marketing spend. Just people who are in town and need somewhere to train.

That 7 AM class Priya booked? Studios get paid whether she's a local or a traveler. Membership works the same either way.

Old gym models relied on inertia. You'd sign an annual contract, go for three weeks, then stop going but keep paying because canceling required a notarized letter delivered by carrier pigeon during a full moon. That model assumed your guilt was worth more than your engagement.

MoveAtlas assumes the opposite: if the product works, you'll keep using it. If it doesn't, you'll leave. No one's locked in. Priya can cancel anytime. She doesn't, because the membership is useful in a way her London gym never was.

She used it in four cities last quarter. She's tried kickboxing, barre, Olympic lifting, and a deeply humbling vinyasa class in Bangkok that she's still thinking about. Her London gym had treadmills and a functional training area that smelled like old rubber.

Variety keeps people showing up. Data backs this up: people with access to multiple workout types train more consistently than people locked into a single gym. A 2019 study published in the *Journal of Sports Sciences* found that workout variety was one of the strongest predictors of long-term adherence. Europeans pay for an average of 4.2 months of gym time they never use—not because they're lazy, but because the same routine in the same room with the same equipment gets boring.

MoveAtlas makes the city your gym. You have access to a thousand options instead of being stuck with one studio's vibe, one instructor's style, one type of training. Friction to try something new is zero.

Airbnb didn't start by building hotels. They built a layer on top of existing infrastructure—empty rooms that were already there, already paid for, just underutilized. MoveAtlas does the same thing for fitness. Studios already exist. Instructors are already teaching. Classes are already scheduled. We're just making it possible for someone in town for two weeks to show up without paying a £25 drop-in fee or signing up for a monthly membership they'll use twice.

Priya's membership works in Singapore because a studio in Tanjong Pagar joined the network. That studio joined because their weekday mornings were empty and they needed a way to fill them without spending money on Facebook ads. MoveAtlas gave them access to people like Priya—professionals who are in town temporarily, who want to work out, who aren't going to commit to a local membership but will absolutely book a class if the process is frictionless.

Studios get paid. Priya gets a workout. No one signs a twelve-month contract.

Flexibility as infrastructure means connecting gyms that already exist and making them accessible to people who move. You don't build a new gym in every city.

If you're reading this, you probably fall into one of two categories.

You travel for work and have felt the quiet frustration of paying for a gym you're not using, or paying drop-in rates that make you wonder if you should just skip the workout and go for a run instead.

Or you stay in one city but have realized that one gym, no matter how nice, will never have everything you want. You like lifting, but also yoga, but also kickboxing, but your gym only does one of those well.

MoveAtlas works for both.

Membership is the same whether you're in one city or five. You book classes in real time through the app. You show up. You train. If you're traveling, your membership travels with you. If you're staying put, you have access to every studio in your city instead of being locked into one.

Cancel anytime. No contracts. No guilt. Just access.

MoveAtlas members use the platform in an average of 2.3 cities per quarter. That's because people move more than the fitness industry wants to admit. You visit family. You take a work trip. You spend a month working remotely from Lisbon because your company lets you and the weather's better.

Your gym should move with you.
